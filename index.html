            <p> Greetings! This website will show you all the images I have completed in 10DGT </p>
            <br>
            <p> Images displayed including images that are manupulated, resized, edited, and combined.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The photo editing software that I used was GIMP, found out more about that in the "About Software" section. </p>
